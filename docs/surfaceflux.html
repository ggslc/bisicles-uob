  <h1><a name='top'>BISICLES surface fluxes</a></h1>
  <p>
    BISICLES has a number of configuration file options that let you specify the rate at which e.g volume
    and/or energy is added to the ice sheet. Usually, there will be a source of ice thickness at the
    upper surface, and one at the lower surface (or base), the same for heat, and a topography flux (bedrock uplift rate). 
    In the code we often call upper surface fluxes 'surface flux'  and lower surface fluxes 'basal flux' but this can be bit 
    confusing because they are both, strictly speaking, 'surface fluxes'. 
  </p>

  <p>Each of the flux quantities can be specified as either a simple flux or a complex fluxes. Simple fluxes just specify a field
    of values (which might be loaded from a file, or computed in some way), while
    complex fluxes combine more than one simple flux. For example, complex fluxes can be used to 
    apply one flux (which might itself be a complex flux ) to floating ice and another to 
    grounded ice, or to add a number of them together.</p>
  <p>
    If you have built the doxygen code documentation, the C++ class hierarchy underlying
    all this is described at <a href='../code/doc/doxygen/html/classSurfaceFlux.html'>classSurfaceFlux.html</a>
  </p>
    
  <h2><a name='whatflux'>Flux quantities</a></h2>
  
  <h3><a name='thicknessflux'>Surface and basal thickness flux</a></h3>
  <p>
    Surface thickness flux (e.g meteoric accumulation) and basal thickness flux (e.g oceanic melting)
    are set through two sections in the configuration file, entries that
    begin
  </p> 
  <pre> 
surfaceFlux.
  </pre>
  <p>
  which select the thickness flux at the upper surface, and entries that
  begin 
  </p>
  <pre> 
basalFlux.
  </pre>
  <p>
    which select the thickness flux at the lower surface. If either is missing, we fall 
    back to the older style (and you get the warning). 
  </p>
  
<h3><a name='topographyflux'>Topography flux</a></h3>

  <p>Bedrock uplift rate can be specified in entries beginning</p>
  <pre> 
topographyFlux.
  </pre>


<h3><a name='heatflux'>Surface and basal heat flux</a></h3>
<p>
Surface and basal heat fluxes are specified in entries that begin
with:
</p>
<pre>
SurfaceHeatBoundaryData.

BasalHeatBoundaryData.
</pre>
<p>
  See the <a href='thermodynamics.html'>thermodynamics</a>  documentation for more details.

<h2><a name='simple'>Simple fluxes</a></h2>

<h3>zeroFlux</h3>
<p>
If you want either flux to be zero, use this. e.g
<pre>
basalFlux.type = zeroFlux 
</pre>
</p>

<h3>constantFlux</h3>
<p>
Another straightforward type, where the flux doesn't depend on time or space.
<pre>
surfaceFlux.type = constantFlux
surfaceFlux.flux_value = 0.3
</pre>
</p>
specifies 0.3 m/a accumulation at the upper surface across the whole domain.

<h3>piecewiseLinearFlux</h3>

This flux is used to construct a rate which
depends, in a piecewise linear fashion, on the thickness
<pre>
surfaceFlux.type = piecewiseLinearFlux
surfaceFlux.n = 2                       
surfaceFlux.abscissae = 50.0 500.0
surfaceFlux.ordinates = 0 -50.0
</pre>
would apply a rather odd flux to the upper surface. Between
thickness of 0 and 50 m, the flux is 0 m/a , while at 500 m and
above it is -50 m/a. It grows linearly from 0 to -50 in between.
This is used as part of a  maskedFlux to provide melt rates in the 
Pine Island Glacier example

<h3>LevelData</h3>

You use a LevelData surface flux (part of the 
<a href='leveldatainterface.html'>LevelData interface</a>) to load a field of accumulation or melt
rates from one or more hdf5 files, in a similar fashion to 
topography and thickness. The data must be cell-centred and sit on 
a domain covering grid such that it can be refined or coarsened to
any of BISICLES levels. For example, the data can sit on a grid
that covers the whole domain at the coarsest level, or at some higher
level. Much of the time it will sit on the same grid as the topography etc.


Let's say you just have one field, acc, in one file, accfile.2d.hdf5, to
be applied for the whole run. Then you add lines like
<pre>
surfaceFlux.type = LevelData
surfaceFlux.n = 1
surfaceFlux.timeStep = 1.0e+10
surfaceFlux.startTime = 0.0
surfaceFlux.fileFormat = accfile.2d.hdf5
surfaceFlux.name = acc
</pre>
On the other hand, lets say you have file accfile0000.2d.hdf5 to
accfile0100.2d.hdf5, which are to be applied from the start of year
0 to the start of year 100. Then you can have
<pre>
surfaceFlux.type = LevelData
surfaceFlux.n = 100
surfaceFlux.timeStep = 1.0
surfaceFlux.startTime = 0.0
surfaceFlux.fileFormat = accfile%4d.2d.hdf5
surfaceFlux.name = acc
</pre>
You might have files accfile1980.2d.hdf5 to accfile2080.2d.hdf5,
in which case you can add
<pre>
surfaceFlux.offset = 1980
</pre>
which would see accfile1980.2d.hdf5 loaded at time t = 0. If
you need accfile1980.2d.hdf5 to be used every year up till
1980, and only then to start loading new data, add
</pre>
surfaceFlux.startTime = 1980
</pre>

You can use this in conjunction with the general option
amr.offsetTime, which lets us add a constant to BISICLES internal 
time. Say, for example, that you had
set 
<pre>
amr.offsetTime = 1926
</pre> 
Then after only 54 years of calculation (say a spin up) 
the 1980 file would be loaded. This is useful if you ran some kind of spinup, starting
at year 0, and decided to use the 54 year checkpoint file to 
initialize some production runs. However, all your files are named according
to a real year, and you would like to see real years in the plot files.

<h3>PythonSurfaceFlux</h3>

Provided that the <a href='pythoninterface.html'>Python interface</a> has be compiled, it is
possible to specify a surface flux through a python function. You need to write
a python function that takes five scalar arguments (x,y,t,thickness,topography).
Let's say that you have created a file my.py
<pre>
#file my.py
def myflux(x,y,t,thck,topg):
    return 1.0e-3 * (thck + topg)
</pre>
then you would include lines like
<pre>
surfaceFlux.type = pythonFlux
surfaceFlux.module = my
surfaceFlux.function = myflux
</pre>
in the input file.

<h3>maskedFlux</h3>

maskedflux divides the domain into grounded ice, floating ice, open land, and open sea.
It is most often used to apply melting to the underside of ice shelves. In effect, it
expands the basalFlux. section (or surfaceFlux. section) to include
basalFlux.grounded., basalFlux.floating., basalFlux.openLand and basalFlux.openSea.
Each section assumes a zeroFlux by default, so
<pre>
basalFlux.type = maskedFlux
basalFlux.grounded.type  = zeroFlux
basalFlux.floating.type = constantFlux
basalFlux.floating.flux_value = -100.0
</pre> 
gives zero flux everywhere except the shelf, where a melt rate of 100 m/a
is applied. Note the maskedFlux is <strong>non-conservative</strong> - it 
restricts flux to the masked. For exmaple, if the supplied floating flux is
a gridded outout from an ocean model, melt/freeze in regions outside of the BISICLES
ice shelf will be discarded. There is a specific option, conservedSumIceShelfFlux, for 
this case (see below).

<h3>conservedSumIceShelfFlux</h3>

Designed for use with ocean models that supply an ice shelf freeze/melt rate over a region
that does not correspond exactly to the BISICLES ice shelf. The regions should be reasonably
close, such that the distribution of flux within the BISICLES ice shelf is representative
of the supplied flux. The flux computed will be restriced to fully-floating cells, but amplified 
so that the total flux into the BISICLES ice shelf is equal to the total supplied flux. 
<pre>
basalFlux.type = conservedSumIceShelfFlux
basalFlux.flux.type = LevelData # the supplied flux
basalFlux.flux.n = 1
basalFlux.flux.fileFormat = coarse_bmb.2d.hdf5 #output from an ocean model
basalFlux.flux.name = bmb
basalFlux.amplication_cap = 2.0 # default, can be ignored
geometry.compute_ocean_connection_iter = 4 # set this to avoid ocean melt applied in (e.g) subglacial lakes
basalFlux.check_ocean_conected = true # default when geometry.compute_ocean_connection_iter > 0, else always false
basalFlux.conserve_sum = true # default
</pre>
Note: if <tt>geometry.compute_ocean_connection_iter < 1</tt>, <tt>check_ocean_connected</tt> is always <tt>false</tt>.

<h3>boxBoundedFlux</h3>

Allows a flux to be restricted to the interior of a 
rectangular region
<pre>
surfaceFlux.type = boxBoundedFlux
surfaceFlux.hi = 170.0e+3 500.0e+3 
surfaceFlux.lo = 100.0e+3 360.0e+3
surfaceFlux.flux.type = constantFlux
surfaceFlux.flux.flux_value = 1
</pre> 
Would apply a flux of 1 m/a in the box whose corners are (170 km , 100 km)
and (500 km , 360 km)

<h3>axbyFlux</h3>

Use axbyFlux to construct a flux F from two fluxes x and y, so that
F = a * x + b * y; a and b are scalars.  Below, we amplify a field loaded
from a file and add a constant to it.
<pre>
basalFlux.type = maskedFlux
basalFlux.grounded.type = zeroFlux

basalFlux.floating.type = axbyFlux
basalFlux.floating.a = 1.5

basalFlux.floating.x.type = LevelData
basalFlux.floating.x.n = 1
basalFlux.floating.x.timeStep = 1.0e+10
basalFlux.floating.x.startTime = 0.0
basalFlux.floating.x.fileFormat = melt-1km.2d.hdf5
basalFlux.floating.x.name = melt

basalFlux.floating.b = 1.0
basalFlux.floating.y.type = constantFlux
basalFlux.floating.y.flux_value = -10.0
</pre>

<h3>productFlux</h3>

<p>
Use productFlux to  construct a flux F from two fluxes flux1 and flux2,
so that F = flux1 * flux2. For example, given a file maskfile.2d.hdf5
that include a field asemask set to 0.0 everywhere but the Amundsen Sea
Embayment, where it is 1.0. A productFlux can be used to set 
a meltrate in the ASE only, like so:
</p>

<pre>
basalFlux.type = maskedFlux
basalFlux.grounded.type = zeroFlux

basalFlux.floating.type = productFlux

basalFlux.floating.flux1.type = constantFlux
basalFlux.floating.flux1.flux_value = -100.0

basalFlux.floating.flux2.type = LevelData
basalFlux.floating.flux2.n = 1
basalFlux.floating.flux2.timeStep = 1.0e+10
basalFlux.floating.flux2.startTime = 0.0
basalFlux.floating.flux2.fileFormat = maskfile.2d.hdf5
basalFlux.floating.flux2.name = asemask
</pre>

<h3>normalizedFlux</h3>
<p>
NormalizedFlux allow the 'amplitude' of a flux to be set, 
so that the integral of the square of the flux over
the whole domain is equal to the amplitude squared multiplied by the
area. E.g.
</p>
<pre>
surfaceFlux.type = normalizedFlux
surfaceFlux.direction.type = constantFlux
surfaceFlux.direction.flux_value = 1.0
surfaceFlux.amplitude = 0.1
</pre>


<h3>compositeFlux</h3>

Use compositeFlux to specify an arbitrary number of fluxes to be added
together - useful in conjunction with boxBoundedFlux. The example
below  applies different piecewiseLinearFlux melt rates to
different regions of an ice shelf

<pre>

basalFlux.type = maskedFlux
basalFlux.grounded.type = constantFlux
basalFlux.grounded.flux_value = 0.0

basalFlux.floating.type = compositeFlux
basalFlux.floating.nElements = 2

#main shelf
basalFlux.floating.element0.type = boxBoundedFlux
basalFlux.floating.element0.hi = 170.0e+3 500.0e+3 
basalFlux.floating.element0.lo = 100.0e+3 360.0e+3
basalFlux.floating.element0.flux.type = piecewiseLinearFlux
basalFlux.floating.element0.flux.n = 2
basalFlux.floating.element0.flux.abscissae = 250.0 500.0
basalFlux.floating.element0.flux.ordinates = 0.0 -120

#slow shelf
basalFlux.floating.element1.type = boxBoundedFlux
basalFlux.floating.element1.hi = 100.0e+3 440.0e+3 
basalFlux.floating.element1.lo = 60.0e+3 360.0e+3
basalFlux.floating.element1.flux.type = piecewiseLinearFlux
basalFlux.floating.element1.flux.n = 2
basalFlux.floating.element1.flux.abscissae = 300.0 500.0
basalFlux.floating.element1.flux.ordinates = 0.0 -20
</pre>


<h3>groundingLineLocalizedFlux</h3>

<strong>This flux is incomplete, more options will be added</strong>
Constructs a flux from two fields G (grounding) and A (ambient), using the formula
H^m ( p * G + (1-p) * A). p is a function which decays
exponentially quickly away from grounded ice with 
a default scale length of 10 km and is equal to 1 on grounded ice. It is usually used within 
a masked flux to  impose strong melting near the current grounding line and 
a smaller ambient flux in the rest of the shelf. m = 0 by default.
In the example, we load two data fields from a file and combine them,
with m (powerOfThickness) = 1.0
<pre>
basalFlux.type = maskedFlux
basalFlux.grounded.type = zeroFlux

basalFlux.floating.type = groundingLineLocalizedFlux
basalFlux.floating.powerOfThickness = 1.0		
basalFlux.floating.groundingLine.type = LevelData
basalFlux.floating.groundingLine.n = 1
basalFlux.floating.groundingLine.timeStep = 1.0e+10
basalFlux.floating.groundingLine.startTime = 0.0
basalFlux.floating.groundingLine.fileFormat = melt.2d.hdf5
basalFlux.floating.groundingLine.name = glmelt

basalFlux.floating.ambient.type = LevelData
basalFlux.floating.ambient.n = 1
basalFlux.floating.ambient.timeStep = 1.0e+10
basalFlux.floating.ambient.startTime = 0.0
basalFlux.floating.ambient.fileFormat = melt.2d.hdf5
basalFlux.floating.ambient.name = ambmelt
