  <H1>BISICLES Pine Island Glacier application</H1>
  <p> These instructions assume that you have working BISICLES executable, including both driver 
     and nctoamr. If that is not the case, there are some <a href='readme.html'>BISICLES build instructions</a> to follow.
     Anne Le Brocq has provided us with the data for this application - thanks Anne.
  </p> 
  <p>
    We will run through the steps needed to run BISICLES on a fairly realistic problem, namely
    a simulation of Pine Island Glacier retreating under the influence of sub-shelf melting.
    To that end we will
    <ol>
      <li>
	<a href='#preprocess'>preprocess some data</a>, that is, pull together data 
	from a few sources, do a few simple calculations, and create  a single netCDF file that
	contains just the data that BISICLES needs. Note however that we will <strong>not</strong> 
	get an especially realistic velocity field using these inputs - for that we need to find our initial 
	values of the basal friction coefficient (beta) and the damage coefficient (phi, or muCoef)
	by solving an <a href='pineislandinverse.html'>inverse problem</a>. 
      </li>
      <li> 
	<a href='#convert'>Convert</a> the data from the netCDF file into the hdf5 based format that BISICLES can read
      </li>
      <li>
      Create a BISICLES <a href='#configure'>input</a> file, which specifies the data file, but also
      parameters which affect the behavior of the solver.
      </li>
      <li>
	<a href='#runpig'>Run a simulation</a>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </p>

  <h2><a name='preprocess'>Pre-processing</a> </h2>
  <p> 
    Pre-processing might involve a few steps : here we take a subset of the original elevation and topography
    data to cover a 256 x 384 grid - because we use a multigrid solver in BISICLES, it is essential that the 
    geometry is of dimensions (nx,ny) = (2^n * a , 2^m * b), where n and m are integers and a and b are small
    integers. We then crudely estimate a basal traction coefficient from velocity data, and invent a temperature structure.
    This step is somewhat iterative with actually running the model - we might find that some part of the topography
    (say) causes us problems down the line, and choose to alter it in some way.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>
      NetCDF no longer provides a fortran API by default, so we have included the file
      pig-bisicles-1km.nc mentioned below.  
    </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    In this case, the pre-processing is done with a FORTRAN 90 program contained in the files friction.f90 and
    mgrelax.f90. mgrelax.f90 just provides a simple multigrid solver that we use to smooth data, so most of the
    work is in friction.f90. To compile this program, change into the appropriate directory 
    <pre>
      > cd $BISICLES_HOME/BISICLES/examples/PineIslandGlacier
    </pre>
    then, if your netcdf is not installed at $BISICLES_HOME/netcdf, 
    edit the file 'GNUMakefile' to give the correct value for NETCDF_HOME. 
    Then  make and execute, like so (you can skip this step)
    <pre>
      > make friction
      > ./friction
    </pre>
    Some text will be written to standard output, and the end result is a file containing 'pig-bisicles-1km.nc'.
    You can have a quick look at the contents</a> by running
    <pre>
      > $BISICLES_HOME/netcdf/serial/bin/ncdump pig-bisicles-1km.nc | head -n 30
    </pre>
    and you should see:
    <pre>
    netcdf pig-bisicles-1km {
dimensions:
        x = 256 ;
        y = 384 ;
        sigma = 10 ;
variables:
        double x(x) ;
                x:units = "m" ;
        double y(y) ;
                y:units = "m" ;
        double sigma(sigma) ;
        double thk(y, x) ;
        double topg(y, x) ;
        double beta_m1(y, x) ;
        double beta_m3(y, x) ;
        double beta_m3_u100(y, x) ;
        double xvel(y, x) ;
        double yvel(y, x) ;
        double velc(y, x) ;
        double divuh(y, x) ;
        double divuhc(y, x) ;

data:

 x = 0, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 5000, 6000, 7000, 8000, 9000, 10000, 11000, 
    12000, 13000, 14000, 15000, 16000, 17000, 18000, 19000, 20000, 21000, 
    22000, 23000, 24000, 25000, 26000, 27000, 28000, 29000, 30000, 31000, 
    32000, 33000, 34000, 35000, 36000, 37000, 38000, 39000, 40000, 41000, 
</pre>
    The first part of the output above is a list of the basic variables we need, and they sit on 
    a uniform, square cell 256 x 384 grid in (x,y) that we'll call the <strong>data level grid</strong>.
    BISICLES will perform its calculations on a set of level grids, one of which
    will have the same mesh spacing as the data level grid, some of which may be 
    coarser , and some of which will be finer. As for the vertical direction, the
    ice sheet is divided into N layers (10 in this case), with the
    top of layer 0 the upper surface and the bottom of layer N-1 at the lower surface.
    Temperature data is stored at the midpoint of each layer.
    The variables are 
    <ol>
    <li>the x and y co-ordinates of the centers of each grid cell </li>
    <li>thk : the thickness of ice</li>
    <li>topg : the bedrock elevation</li>
    <li>beta : the basal traction coefficient</li>
    <li>tempXXXXXX : temperatures at the mid-point of layer XXXXXX</li>
    </ol>
    The remainder are only needed by the <a href='pineislandinverse.html'>inverse problem</a>
    In fact, only thk,topg, and beta are essential : it is easy enough to specify either a constant rate 
    factor A, or a constant ice temperature, in BISICLES configuration file. If you are starting
    a new problem, it is likely easiest to start with thk, topg, and beta (possibly a constant beta, though
    in Pine Island Glacier a spatially varying beta is required if the simulation is to look at all realistic).
  </p>
  <h2><a name='convert'>Conversion</a> </h2>
  BISICLES cannot (yet) read  netCDF data directly, instead we must use the nctoamr tool to 
  convert it into a Chombo AMR hierarchy stored in an .hdf5 file. Run
  <pre>
    $BISICLES_HOME/BISICLES/code/filetools/nctoamr2d.Linux.64.g++.gfortran.DEBUG.ex pig-bisicles-1km.nc pig-bisicles-1km.2d.hdf5 thk topg beta_m1 beta_m3 beta_m3_u100 xvel yvel velc divuh divuhc
  </pre>
  and you should end up with a file called pig-bisicles-1km.2d.hdf5 that has the same data as pig-bisicles-1km.nc.
  You can inspect the contents of this file with the h5ls and h5dump programs, but it won't be pretty. Instead,
  copy the file to your workstation and open into <a href='visit.html'>VisIt</a> which
  has a special module for viewing Chombo AMR hierarchies.
  <h2><a name='configure'>Configuration file</a> </h2>
  <p>
    As in the MISMIP3D example, we can generate a bunch of configuration files by running
    a script
    <pre>
      > sh make_inputs.sh
    </pre>
    which should create several files, with names like <quote>inputs.pigv5.1km.l1l2.l2</quote>, where
    l1l2 stands for the choice of the Schoof-Hindmarsh L1L2 physics (as opposed to ssa, for shelfy-stream approximation (aka shallow-shelf approximation))
    and l2 stands for 2 levels of refinement (on top of the base level, to give us 2 level grids). The names
    aren't important of course, only the contents. Below, we'll look at the entries in inputs.pigv5.1km.l1l2.l2.
    </p>
  <p>
The first section sets up the domain. 
<pre> 
#domain details
main.domain_size = 256e+3 384e+3 1.0e+3
amr.num_cells = 64 96 10 #quarter data resolution (4 km)
amr.is_periodic = 0 0 0
</pre>
First, we have a comment, beginning with #.
Next three quantities are given for the domain size, the third of which is ignored for now.
Also notice that amr.num_cells specifes the coarsest mesh.
The first two numbers specify the base resolution, and because the data level sits on a  256 x 384
grid, the choice of a 64 x 96 grid means that the data on the base grid
will be coarsened by a factor of 4 from the input data. The third number is the number of vertical layers,
which remains the same on every grid.
</p>

<p>
The next specifies the bulk constitutive relation and its attendant rate factor
<pre>
#bulk constitutive relation and parameters
main.constitutiveRelation = L1L2
#main.rateFactor = constRate
#constRate.epsSqr0 = 1.0e-12
#constRate.A =  4.0e-17
main.rateFactor = patersonRate
PatersonRate.epsSqr0 = 1.0e-12
</pre>
<p>
constRate allow us to specify A, petersonRate allows us to chose a temperature dependent A(T)
(as in, for example, Cuffey and Paterson, 2010).
</p>
<p>
  We also need to specify a rule for basal friction: here we are using a power
  law (Weertman) rule, where the friction |T(x,y)| = beta(x,y) * |u(x,y)|^1/3.
</p> 
<pre>
#basal friction relation parameters
main.basalFrictionRelation = powerLaw
BasalFrictionPowerLaw.m = 0.3333
</pre>


<p>
Next we specify the input data.
<pre>
#geometry,temperature & basal friction input data
geometry.problem_type = LevelData
geometry.beta_type = LevelData
temperature.type = LevelData
#temperature.type = constant
#temperature.value = 268

amr.sigma = 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0

inputLevelData.geometryFile = pig-bisicles-1km.2d.hdf5
inputLevelData.frictionFile = pig-bisicles-1km.2d.hdf5
inputLevelData.temperatureFile = pig-bisicles-1km.2d.hdf5
inputLevelData.thicknessName = thk
inputLevelData.topographyName = topg
inputLevelData.frictionName = beta_m3
inputLevelData.temperatureName = temp000000
</pre>
we have chosen to load all our data from one file, though it is possible
to load the geometry (thickness and topography), the basal friction coefficient,
and the temperature from three separate files. We should also include an
entry for amr.sigma, which specifies the sigma values of the layer interfaces, starting
from the upper surface and finishing at the base. Therefore, amr.sigma should list n+1
numbers, where n is the number of layers. As for inputLevelData.temperatureName, 
we need to give the name of the first layer's temperature field,
and the remaining n-1 will be read from the next n-1 fields in the file, in order.
</p>

<p>
It is also possible to specify a few physical constants, such 
as ice density (constants.ice_density), the gravitational constant
(constants.gravity), and water density (constants.water_density),
<pre>
#physical constants
constants.ice_density=918
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Surface mass balance is chosen in the next section.
<pre>
#surface fluxes
SurfaceFlux.type = constantFlux
SurfaceFlux.flux_value = 0.3

BasalFlux.type =  maskedFlux
BasalFlux.grounded.type = zeroFlux
BasalFlux.floating.type = piecewiseLinearFlux
BasalFlux.floating.n = 2
BasalFlux.floating.abscissae = 50.0 500.0
BasalFlux.floating.ordinates = 0 -50.0
</pre>
Here, we have chosen a constant rate of accumulation at the upper surface.
At the low surface, we have used the maskedFlux option in order to 
select no flux in the grounded region, and a piecewise linear relation between
melting and thickness beneath the ice shelves. 
</p>

<p>
Next up is the calving law
<pre>
#calving model
CalvingModel.type = FixedFrontCalvingModel
CalvingModel.min_thickness = 1.0
</pre>
DeglaciationCalvingModelA maintains zero ice thickness in regions that initially have no ice
and also prevents ice thickness from dropping below min_thickness. In effect, it works to maintain
a fixed calving front (though a large region of ice only 1m thick might as well not be present at
all, so something like a retreating calving front is possible). It is
OK to set CalvingModel.min_thickness = 0.0, in which case the Calving front can retreat, and
is irreversible. However, that can result in regions of floating ice unconnected to grounded ice,
in which case the stress-balance equations become ill-posed.
</p>

<p>
The next several parameters are related to the way the stress-balance equations
are solved. 
<pre>
#velocity solve type -- 0 = Picard, 1 = JFNK
amr.velocity_solver_type = 1

#initial guess 
amr.do_initial_velocity_guess = 1
amr.do_initial_velocity_solve = 1
amr.initial_velocity_guess_type = 1 # linear PDE
amr.initial_velocity_guess_const_mu = 1.0e+6
amr.initial_velocity_guess_solver_type = 1 # use JFNK solver's linear mode

#JFNK parameters
JFNKSolver.vtopSafety = 0.95
JFNKSolver.minPicardIterations = 3
JFNKSolver.maxIter = 10
JFNKSolver.absTol = 1.0e+0
JFNKSolver.relTol = 1.0e-3
JFNKSolver.solverType = 0 #Relax solver
JFNKSolver.RelaxRelTol = 2.0e-3
JFNKSolver.maxRelaxIter = 20
JFNKSolver.normType = 0
JFNKSolver.verbosity = 5
JFNKSolver.vtopRelaxTol = 0.005
JFNKSolver.vtopRelaxMinIter = 4
JFNKSolver.numMGSmooth = 8
JFNKSolver.numMGIter = 1
JFNKSolver.h = 0.025
JFNKSolver.switchRate = 2.0
#JFNKSolver.writeResiduals = true
#JFNKSolver.muMin = 1.0e+4
#JFNKSolver.uMaxAbs = 1.0e+6
</pre>
We will not say much about these, except that if JFNKSolver.writeResiduals = true is present
(not commented, as it is above), a file named 'jknkopres.XXXXXX.2d.hdf5' will be written to disk
on every evaluation of the stress-balance equation's residuals, containing velocity and residual data.
These are useful when trying to understand solver failures.
</p>

<p>
Various time stepping parameters come next
<pre>
#time stepping
main.maxTime = 75  # maximum time to run to
main.maxStep = 10000   # maximum number of steps to run
amr.temporal_accuracy = 1
amr.cfl = 0.25  
amr.initial_cfl = 0.25  
amr.max_dt_grow_factor = 1.1 
amr.time_step_ticks = 1
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Below, we ask for detailed plots every 1 year, and specify the
filename pattern (we will get files called plot.pigv5.1km.l1l2.2lev.XXXXXX.2d.hdf5 in this case)
<pre>
#plotting options
#amr.plot_interval = 1
amr.plot_time_interval = 1.0
amr.plot_prefix = plot.pigv5.1km.l1l2.2lev.
#amr.write_preSolve_plotfiles = true
amr.write_solver_rhs = 1
</pre>
</p>
<p>
Check point files cannot be viewed in VisIt, but can be used to continue a
run from the point where the check point was written. Specify
a file in the amr.restart_file to that end.
<pre>
#check points
amr.check_interval = 10
amr.check_prefix = chk.pigv5.1km.l1l2.2lev.
amr.check_overwrite = 0
amr.verbosity = 5
#amr.restart_file = chk.pigv5.1km.l1l2.2lev.000100.2d.hdf5
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Finally, we have a number of AMR parameters
<pre>
#AMR mesh options
amr.maxLevel = 10 # finest level allowed in simulation
amr.ref_ratio = 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2
amr.regrid_interval = 1  # number of timesteps between regridding
amr.blockFactor = 8      # block factor used in grid generation
amr.fill_ratio = 0.85    # how efficient are the grids
amr.nestingRadius = 1    # proper nesting radius required
amr.tags_grow = 4        # amount to buffer tags
amr.tagSubsetBoxesFile = tag_subset.pigv5
amr.tagCap = 1

amr.interpolate_zb = 0 #go back to the IBC to regrid geometry
amr.max_box_size = 32 # largest box length allowed

#AMR tagging
amr.tag_on_grad_velocity = 0

amr.tag_on_grounded_laplacian_velocity = 0 
amr.lap_vel_tagging_val = 30

amr.tag_grounding_line = 1
amr.grounding_line_tagging_min_vel = 20

#misc options
amr.verbosity = 5
</pre>
In this case we only refine close to the grounding line.
amr.tagCap means the finest level which will be tagged for refinement,
while the entry amr.tagSubsetBoxesFile = tag_subset.pigv5 selects a subset
of every grid where refinement is permitted. The contents of tag_subset.pigv5 are shown 
below 
<pre>
level 0
1
( (16,16) (47,81) (0,0) )

level 1
0

level 2
0

level 3
0

level 4
0

level 5
0

level 6
0

level 7
0

level 8
0

level 9
0

level 10
0

</pre>
</p>
There are 10 entries (corresponding to amr.max_level=10 : level 10 is never refined),
each of which consists of the string level X on one line, the number, n, of subset boxes on 
the next line, then n lines indicating the indices of the corners of the box.
For now, follow this format exactly (if amr.tagSubsetBoxesFile exists at all) . We'll improve this soon to
allow comments and so on.
</p>
<h2><a name='runpig'>Running a simulation</a> </h2>
If you have a parallel workstation, run a simulation with 4 or 5 levels of refinement,
e.g
<pre>
nohup mpirun -np 4 $BISICLES_HOME/BISICLES/code/exec2D/driver2d.Linux.64.mpic++.gfortran.DEBUG.OPT.MPI.ex inputs.pigv5.1km.l1l2.l4 &
</pre>
On a serial computer, run a simulation with 2 or 3 levels of refinement. e.g
<pre>
> $BISICLES_HOME/BISICLES/code/exec2D/driver2d.Linux.64.g++.gfortran.DEBUG.OPT.ex inputs.pigv5.1km.l1l2.l2 > sout.0 2>err.0 &
</pre>
<p>
In both cases, you can view the resulting plot*2d.hdf5 files in visit. You should see
the grounding line of Pine Island Glacier retreat rather rapidly in either case, and the
AMR mesh changing to follow it.
If you do have the time, try running the simulation for a range of finest meshes, and observe the
way that the grounding line motion differs. You should see that the rate of retreat grows
as the finest mesh spacing decreases, with the difference between no refinement and one level of refinement being much 
larger than the difference between four and five levels of refinement.
