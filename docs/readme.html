<h1><a name='top'>BISICLES build instructions</a></h1>

<p>These are the instructions to build BISICLES against the Chombo 3.2 release. To build against the older 3.1 Chombo release, go <a href='readme-3.1.html'>here<a/>

<p>To build (and run) BISICLES you need to</p>
<ol>
  <li> Meet the <a href='#sysreq'>system requirements</a></li>
  <li> <a href='#svnco'>Check out</a> the source code</li>
  <li> Set up some third party <a href='#deps'>dependencies</a></li>
  <li> <a href='#chombo'> Configure Chombo</a> by editing some definitions in a makefile</li>
  <li> <a href='#bikeconf'>Configure BISICLES</a> additional options by editing some definitions in another makefile</li>
  <li> <a href='#bisicles'> Compile driver</a>, the main standalone BISICLES executable.</li>
  <li> <a href='#example'> Run driver on a simple problem </a> to ensure that it works</li>
</ol>


<h2><a name="sysreq"> System requirements.</a></h2>
<p> 
  BISICLES requires the GNU/Linux operating system (actually, it should compile and run elsewhere,
  but we never do that), plus both C++ and FORTRAN compilers, a GNU-compatible make, subversion, and Perl.
  Python is optional but highly recommended - BISICLES has numerous optional python components.
  On the whole, life is easiest with gcc (including g++ and gfortran), and we shall assume that
  is what will be used. To build the parallel version, you need an MPI environment, which provides 
  the mpicc and mpicxx  (or equivalents). You will also need 
  <a href='https://wci.llnl.gov/codes/visit/home.html'>VisIt</a></li> to view the data BISICLES 
produces (other programs can be put to use, but VisIt is by far the most convenient)</p>
<p>
  There are some <a href='sites.html'>site specific notes</a>: look at these before proceeding
  if you are installing on an Ubuntu or Debian workstation, on a Cray (e.g ARCHER, NERSC),
  or on any of the other machines that BISICLES has been used before.
</p>
<h2><a name="svnco"> Check out the source code.</a> </h2>
<p> Since this readme file lives in the source code repository, you might have already checked the source code
  out. There are two source trees, Chombo, and BISICLES, and the rest of this guide assumes that you
  have a directory called $BISICLES_HOME which contains the two.</p>

<p> To obtain the source trees, you first need an <a href='https://anag-repo.lbl.gov/'>ANAG repository account</a>.
  Once that is sorted out, create a root directory for both source trees
<pre>
  > export BISICLES_HOME=/wherever/you/like #assumes bash...
  > mkdir -p $BISICLES_HOME
  > cd $BISICLES_HOME
  > svn co https://anag-repo.lbl.gov/svn/Chombo/release/3.2 Chombo
</pre>
<p>
  Next, decide which BISICLES branch you want. 
   users will
  want the main BISICLES development branch (trunk),which is fairly stable
  since experimental code is developed on other branches. In that case run
</p>
<pre>
  > svn co https://anag-repo.lbl.gov/svn/BISICLES/public/trunk BISICLES 
</pre>
<p>
The advantage of trunk is that bug fixes
are published there first. There is also a development branch available on github
</p>
<pre>
  > git clone https://github.com/ggslc/bisicles-uob BISICLES
</pre>

You may prefer the current release, which
changes infrequently.
</p>
<pre>
  > svn co https://anag-repo.lbl.gov/svn/BISICLES/public/release/1.4 BISICLES
</pre>
<p>  
  You may want one of the other branches, especially if you are working with any of
  the BISICLES developers to introduce new features, but in that case you will
  probably know which one you need.

<p>
  Note
  that you do not need to layout your source directories as indicated above, or even
  follow the rest of these notes exactly. If you want some other layout, note
  the following
  <ul>
    <li>
      Chombo needs to know where your hdf5 includes and libraries are to be found. It expects
      these to be defined in variables HDFINCFLAGS , HDFLIBFLAGS , HDFMPIINCFLAGS, HDFMPILIBFLAGS, which
      are read from a file <tt>/path/to/Chombo/lib/mk/Make.defs.local</tt>, which you must create.
    </li>
    <li>
      Chombo will determine the location of PETSc (if needed) from the PETSC_DIR environment variable
    </li>
    <li>
      BISICLES needs to know where
      the Chombo includes and libraries are to be found (and possibly the same for python and netcdf).
      By default it assumes that there is a <tt>Chombo</tt> source tree at the same level as
      the BISICLES source tree, but this can be overridden by setting the environment variable
      <tt>$CHOMBO_HOME</tt>. e.g if you have Chombo in
      <tt>/path/to/Chombo/3.2</tt> then set <tt>CHOMBO_HOME=/path/to/Chombo/3.2/lib</tt>
    </li>
    <li>
      BISICLES may need to know where python and netcdf includes and libraries are to be found,
      these are defined in <tt>/path/to/BISICLES/code/mk/Make.defs</tt> (as is <tt>$CHOMBO_HOME</tt>)
      which may attempt to read them
      from a file called <tt>/path/to/BISICLES/code/mk/Make.defs.$UNAMEN</tt>, where
      <tt>$UNAME</tt> is the output from <tt>uname -n</tt> or <tt>Make.defs.none</tt> if there is no such file.
    </li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2><a name="deps"> Dependencies.</a> </h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>fftw:</strong> Some optional components (e.g the BuelerGIA module contributed by Sam Kachuck)
  require <a href='https://fftw.org'>fftw</a>. Most operating systems will allow you
  to install this in a sensible fashion. You need to know where it is installed - often /usr
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>hdf5:</strong> Chombo requires the hdf5 libraries.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>petsc:</strong> Chombo 3.2 also contains an optional interface to the <a href='http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/'> PETSc</a>  solver library.
    We have found that using the Chombo AMR interface to the petsc algebraic multigrid solvers (either GAMG or Hypre's BoomerAMG) can
    substantially improve the performance of the nonlinear ice velocity solve for problems where the native Chombo geometric multigrid (GMG) solvers struggle. 
  </li>
  <li> <strong>netcdf:</strong> BISICLES includes some complementary tools which require netcdf, and can be linked with the Glimmer-CISM model,
  which also requires netcdf. As with hdf5, there may be a suitable version installed on your system
  but you may need to compile netCDF from source.
</li>
<li> <strong>python:</strong> BISICLES has an optional python interface</li>
<li> <strong>gdal:</strong> used by the complentary <emph>flatten</emph> tool to add projcetion data to output files </li>
</ul>

<p>
  If you're working on a system which is maintained by somebody else (like, for example, the supercomputers at NERSC),
  it's likely that most, if not all, of these dependencies have been built and installed already, which can save you some effort.
  So, check to see what's already installed, with an eye open to the possibility that things have been configured in some
  odd way which makes them unusable for us, in which case you you're back to where you were anyway). See the
  <a href='sites.html'>site specific notes</a>, because certain common environments, such as the Cray XC30/40,
  and recent versions of Debian and Ubuntu GNU/Linux, have well designed systems for satisfying some of these dependencies,
  notably fftw, hdf5 and netcdf. <strong>Do not follow the instructions below for hdf5 and netcdf on those machines, instead follow the much simpler instructions in the  <a href='sites.html'>site specific notes</a></strong>
</p>

<p>
  There should be a script, download_dependencies.sh (in the same directory as this file, 
  $BISICLES_HOME/BISICLES/docs) that will get the (version 1.10.10) hdf5 sources and  
  unpack them, twice : once into hdf5/serial/src and once into hdf5/parallel/src. 
  It assumes $BISICLES_HOME is set. It should contain the following
</p>
<pre>
cd $BISICLES_HOME
echo `pwd`

#get hdf5 sources
if !(test -e hdf5-1.10.10.tar.bz2) then
    echo "downloading hdf5-1.10.9.tar.gz"
    wget https://support.hdfgroup.org/ftp/HDF5/releases/hdf5-1.10/hdf5-1.10.10/src/hdf5-1.10.10.tar.bz2
fi

mkdir -p hdf5/parallel/src
tar -jxf  hdf5-1.10.10.tar.bz2 -C hdf5/parallel/src

mkdir -p hdf5/serial/src
tar -jxf  hdf5-1.10.10.tar.bz2 -C hdf5/serial/src


#get netcdf sources

if !(test -e netcdf-c-4.9.2.tar.gz) then
    echo "downloading netcdf-4.9.2.tar.gz"
    wget https://downloads.unidata.ucar.edu/netcdf-c/4.9.2/netcdf-c-4.9.2.tar.gz
fi
mkdir -p netcdf/parallel/src
tar -zxf netcdf-c-4.9.2.tar.gz -C netcdf/parallel/src

mkdir -p netcdf/serial/src
tar -zxf netcdf-c-4.9.2.tar.gz -C netcdf/serial/src
</pre>
If you want to build a single-processor BISICLES, then build hdf5 in hdf5/serial/src. If 
you want to build a multi-processor BISICLES, then build hdf5 in hdf5/parallel/src.
Similar pairs of directories will be built for netcdf.
</p>
<h3>Building serial hdf5 </h3>
Before starting, make sure that you can run gcc.
Enter the appropriate source directory
<pre>
> cd $BISICLES_HOME/hdf5/serial/src/hdf5-1.10.10/
</pre>
and configure hdf5 like so
<pre>
CC=gcc CFLAGS=-fPIC ./configure --prefix=$BISICLES_HOME/hdf5/serial/
</pre>
<p>
The -fPIC flag will be useful later if you want to build the experimental <a href='libamrfile.html'>libamrfile</a>
shared library that can be used to manipulate Chombo (and BISICLES) output with languages 
that support a plain C function calling convention, like FORTRAN 90, GNU R, Python and MATLAB. 
Configure will spit out a long list of tests, and hopefully pass them all. 
Don't worry that the C++ and Fortran languages are not enabled : Chombo uses the C interface, 
and (when we come to compile that too), so does netcdf. Assuming this is all OK, type
</p>
<pre>
> make install
</pre>
<p>
and you, after a round of compiling and copying, you 
should see that the hdf5 libraries bin,doc,include and src have appeared in $BISICLES_HOME/hdf5/serial/.
</p>
<h3>Building parallel hdf5 </h3>

Before starting, make sure that the mpi environment is in place and that you can run mpicc.
Enter hdf5/parallel/src/hdf5-1.10.10/ directory
<pre>
> cd $BISICLES_HOME/hdf5/parallel/src/hdf5-1.10.10/
</pre>
and configure hdf5, this time enabling MPI through the use of mpicc in place of gcc
<pre>
> CC=mpicc ./configure --prefix=$BISICLES_HOME/hdf5/parallel/ --enable-parallel=yes
</pre>
<p>
This time, configure's final report should the line 'Parallel HDF5: mpicc '
Assuming this is all OK, type</p>
<pre>
> make install
</pre>
<p>
this time, the bin,doc,include and src directories should end up  in $BISICLES_HOME/hdf5/parallel/.
</p>

<h3><a name='cdf'>Building serial netcdf</a> </h3>
<p>
  <strong>The main BISICLES program does not need netcdf: you only need it to convert between
    hdf5 (which BISICLES reads and write) and netcdf formats (which are popular in climate modelling).
    If you have problems with this, move on.
  </strong>
  Before starting, make sure that you can run gcc,g++ and gfortran.
  Enter the appropriate source directory
  <pre>
    > cd $BISICLES_HOME/netcdf/serial/src/netcdf-c-4.9.2/
  </pre>
  Now, netcdf needs to link hdf5 : it doesn't really matter which version but we might as
well use the one we have. So, we have 
a custom configure line
<pre>
> CC=gcc CPPFLAGS=-I$BISICLES_HOME/hdf5/serial/include/ CXX=g++ FC=gfortran LDFLAGS=-L$BISICLES_HOME/hdf5/serial/lib/  ./configure --prefix=$BISICLES_HOME/netcdf/serial --enable-dap=no
</pre>
Next, compile, test, and install netcdf
<pre>
> make check install
</pre>
and assuming all goes well, the C API netcdf 4.9.2 will now be installed in $BISICLES_HOME/netcdf/serial.
</p>
<p>
  Recent versions of netcdf (inclusing 4.9.2) do not include a Fortran API. BISICLES does not require
  this, but related programs might.
</p>

<h3>Building parallel netcdf </h3>

<p>
So far, the only difference between parallel and serial netcdf installs 
is the link to parallel hdf5 and the use of the MPI compiler wrapper. 
Possibly, building two versions of netcdf is a waste of time. 
</p>
<p><strong>parallel netcdf may be needed to compile parallel glimmer-CISM, otherwise it can be skipped</strong>.</p>
<pre>
> cd $BISICLES_HOME/netcdf/parallel/src/netcdf-4.9.2/
> CC=mpicc CXX=mpiCC FC=mpif90  CPPFLAGS="-DgFortran -I$BISICLES_HOME/hdf5/parallel/include/" LDFLAGS=-L$BISICLES_HOME/hdf5/parallel/lib/  ./configure --prefix=$BISICLES_HOME/netcdf/parallel --enable-dap=no
> make  check install
</pre>

</p>
<h3><a name="petsc">Installing PETSc</a></h3>
<p>
If we're planning to use the PETSc solver interface, it's a good idea to install PETSc before building Chombo. It's likely that some version of petsc may be pre-installed on your system -- we need petsc version 3.3.4 or later, configured with hypre. If that is not available, you will need to build it.
</P>
<ol>
  <li> First, download PETSc:
<pre>
> cd $BISICLES_HOME
> git clone -b release https://gitlab.com/petsc/petsc.git petsc-src
</pre>

<li>  Configure petsc. To build a parallel version and install it in $BISICLES_HOME/petsc, 

<pre>
> mkdir -p $BISICLES_HOME/petsc
> cd $BISICLES_HOME/petsc-src
> ./configure --download-fblaslapack=yes --download-hypre=yes -with-x=0 --with-c++support=yes --with-mpi=yes --with-hypre=yes --prefix=$BISICLES_HOME/petsc --with-c2html=0 --with-ssl=0
</pre> 

The petsc install system is pretty helpful and will tell you what to do
if it runs into problems (unlike, say, Chombo)

<li> Follow the instructions to make and install the library</li>

  <li> Finally, set the PETSC_DIR environment variable,
    which Chombo will use in order to find your PETSc installation. If using bash, 
<pre>
> export PETSC_DIR=$BISICLES_HOME/petsc
</pre>
Use setenv rather than export in csh, tcsh etc.
These variables need to be set whenever you compile against petsc, so consider adding them to
.bash_profile or .bashrc or the startup script for your shell.
</ol>


</p>
<h2><a name="chombo">Chombo configuration</a></h2>
<p>
Next we need to set up Combo's configuration (which BISICLES will inherit automatically).
The main task here is create a file called $BISICLES_HOME/Chombo/lib/mk/Make.defs.local,
and there is version stored in this directory that should be easy enough to edit.
First, copy it into $BISICLES_HOME
</p>
<pre>
> cp $BISICLES_HOME/BISICLES/docs/Make.defs.local $BISICLES_HOME
</pre>
<p>
At the very least, you will need to  edit the line that reads
</p>
<pre> 
BISICLES_HOME=..., 
</pre>
<p>
to give the correct value. If you don't have MPI, there are a few lines to comment out. 
You might also want to tinker with the optimization flags and so on. Then create a link
so that Chombo sees Make.defs.local in the place it expects
</p>
<pre>
>ln -s $BISICLES_HOME/Make.defs.local $BISICLES_HOME/Chombo/lib/mk/Make.defs.local
</pre>
<p>
If you want the include compenents (e.g BuelerGIA) that require fftw set
</p>
<pre>
USE_FFTW=TRUE
#make sure FFTWDIR is correct (contains e.g include/fftw3.h if you set USE_FFTW=TRUE
FFTWDIR=/path/to/fftw # often /usr
</pre>


<h2><a name="bikeconf">Configuring BISICLES</a></h2>

<p>
A makefile containing options specific to BISICLES (rather than Chombo) 
is located at
</p>
<pre>
$BISICLES_HOME/BISICLES/code/mk/Make.defs
</pre>
<p>
You do not usually need to edit that file, but instead, add a file
named for your machine to that directory. Run 'uname -n' to find out the 
name of you machine, e.g on a host called 'mymachine'
</p>
<pre>
> cd $BISICLES_HOME/BISICLES/code/mk/
> uname -n
mymachine
> cp Make.defs.template Make.defs.mymachine
</pre>
<p>
Alternatively, create a file called Make.defs.none
</p>



<h3>Python</h3>
<p>
To make use of the <a href='pythoninterface.html'>python interface</a>, you need to 
ensure that you have a suitable
python installation. This is usually straightforward in modern GNU/linux distributions,
since Python is so widespread. The aim is to make sure that the
the variables PYTHON_INC and PYTHON_LIBS are correctly defined. 
Make.defs.template attempts to set these variables by running
</p>
<pre>
python3-config --includes
python3-config --libs
</pre>
which works on many workstations but may not be what you want.
In that case, you need to find out where the header file "Python.h" lives,
and what linker flags you need. For example, edit  Make.defs.mymachine to set
<pre>
PYTHON_INC=/usr/include/python3.10
PYTHON_LIBS=-lpython3.10
</pre> 
<p>
There are several machine specific examples in the same directory. If you do not want
the python interface for some reason (we advise having it), make sure that
PYTHON_INC is not set</p>

<h3>NetCDF</h3>
<p>
Netcdf is not needed by the main BISICLES code, but there are
tools and examples to do depend upon it. The aim is to set the
NETCDF_INC and NETCDF_LIBS variables in (e.g) Make.defs.mymachine, and
once again Make.defs.template shows one way to do this if 
netcdf is installed, by running
</p>
<pre>
nc-config --includedir
nc-config --libs
</pre>
<p>
If that is not suitable, for example if you built <a href='#cdf'>netcdf as above</a>,  
you need to find the location netcdf.h. Edit Make.defs.mymachine to set
</p>
<pre>
NC_CONFIG=$(BISICLES_HOME)/netcdf/serial/bin/nc-config
HDF_SER_DIR=$(BISICLES_HOME)/hdf5/serial
NETCDF_HOME=$(shell $(NC_CONFIG) --prefix)
NETCDF_INC=-I$(shell $(NC_CONFIG) --includedir)
NETCDF_LIBS=$(shell $(NC_CONFIG) --libs) -Wl,-rpath $(NETCDF_HOME)/lib -lhdf5_hl -lhdf5 -Wl,-rpath $(HDF_SER_DIR)/lib
</pre>

<h2><a name="bisicles">Building basic (standalone) BISICLES</a></h2>

<p>Now we are ready to build one or more BISICLES executables. If you plan to do development
work on the code itself, you will want to build an unoptimized version to run in gdb. Run
<pre>
> cd $BISICLES_HOME/BISICLES/code/exec2D
> make all
</pre>
This will build a set of Chombo libraries, and then BISICLES. Hopefully, it will complete without errors, and you
will end up with an executable called <quote>driver2d.Linux.64.g++.gfortran.DEBUG.ex</quote>. 
This one is most useful for low-level debugging of the code - if you 
are not planning to do that, there is no need for it.  If you have a serial computer only, run
<pre>
> cd $BISICLES_HOME/BISICLES/code/exec2D
> make all OPT=TRUE
</pre>
to get an optimized executable called <quote>driver2d.Linux.64.g++.gfortran.DEBUG.OPT.ex</quote>. 
</p>
An optimized  parallel executable <quote>driver2d.Linux.64.mpic++.gfortran.DEBUG.OPT.MPI.ex</quote> can be built like so
<pre>
> cd $BISICLES_HOME/BISICLES/code/exec2D
> make all OPT=TRUE MPI=TRUE
</pre>
For serious runs, this is the one you need. Even on workstations with a few processors (like dartagnan.ggy.bris.ac.uk) noticeable (2X-4X)  speed improvements are realized by running parallel code, and on clusters like bluecrystal or hopper.nersc.gov we have obtained 100X speedups for big enough problems (and hope to obtain 1000X speedups).
<p>
<p>
Finally, should you feel the urge, you can have a non-optimized parallel version, which can be used for hunting down low-level
bugs that crop up in parallel operation but not in serial operation. 
</p>
To build with PETSc support, add "USE_PETSC=TRUE" to your build line, e.g.
<pre>
> cd $BISICLES_HOME/BISICLES/code/exec2D
> make all OPT=TRUE MPI=TRUE USE_PETSC=TRUE
</pre>

<h3><a name="makeclean">Make clean</a></h3>
<p>On occasion it might be necessary to rebuild BISICLES entirely, rather than just those parts where a file
  has changed. To do so, run</p>
  <pre>cd $BISICLES_HOME/BISICLES/code</pre>

  <p> then </p>
  
<pre>make clean</pre>
for unoptimized, serial builds, 
<pre>make clean OPT=TRUE</pre>
for optimized serial builds, and
<pre>make clean OPT=TRUE MPI=TRUE</pre>
for optimized parallel builds</p>

<h3><a name="makerealclean">Make realclean</a></h3>
<p> In the event even more houscleaning is desired, the "realclean" target does everything the "clean" target does, and additionally removes many other user-generated files, including all files with the ".hdf5" suffix (including checkpoint and plot files). 

<h2><a name="example">Running BISICLES on a simple problem</a></h2>
<p>
All the data to run <a href='http://homepages.ulb.ac.be/~fpattyn/mismip3d/welcome.html'>Frank Pattyn's MISMIP3D P075 experiment</a> is already
present. Change to the MISMIP3D subdirectory, and generate some input files from a template.
<pre>
> cd $BISICLES_HOME/BISICLES/examples/MISMIP3D
> sh make_inputs.sh
</pre>
then we are ready to go.
</p>
<h3>Running on a serial Workstation</h3>
On a serial machine, try the 3 AMR level problem (which will have
a resolution of 800 m at the grounding line, and 6.25 km far from it).
<pre>
$BISICLES_HOME/BISICLES/code/exec2D/driver2d.Linux.64.g++.gfortran.DEBUG.OPT.ex  inputs.mismip3D.p075.l1l2.l3 > sout.0 2>err.0 &
</pre>
You can watch progress by typing
<pre>
> tail -f sout.0
</pre>
and eventually, you will get a series of plot*2d.hdf5 files that you can view in visit
</p>

<h3>Running on a parallel Workstation</h3>
If you have a parallel machine, run the 5 AMR level problem (which will have
a resolution of 200 m at the grounding line, and 6.25 km far from it).
<pre>
> nohup mpirun -np 4 $BISICLES_HOME/BISICLES/code/exec2D/driver2d.Linux.64.mpic++.gfortran.DEBUG.OPT.MPI.ex inputs.mismip3D.p075.l1l2.l5 &
</pre>
replace -np 4 with the appropriate count for your machine: this may be many as the number
of CPU cores, but perhaps fewer, because these will typically share some resources. 
Ideally, do a series of scaling experiments
to come up with a graph like the example below. This example is based 
on real world problem set in the Amundsen Sea Embayment, and includes
both in-memory calculations (CPU) and file I/O. File I/O is often
expensive, especially on clusters. The example below measures
the time taken to evolve the model over 16 timesteps and write
both a checkpoint and plot file (each around 200 MB).
